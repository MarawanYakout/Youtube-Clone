# YouTube Clone 

This repository showcases my **front-end web development** skills, specifically in **HTML** and **CSS**. The project is a **responsive YouTube clone** that replicates the core layout and styling of YouTube's interface, including a **header**, **sidebar**, and **video thumbnails**.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The project is structured with a functional header, sidebar, and main video section to replicate YouTube’s design.
- **Multiple CSS Files**: The CSS is divided into separate files for better organization and maintainability:
  - `general.css`: Base styling across the project.
  - `header.css`: Styling for the header section.
  - `sidebar.css`: Styling for the sidebar icons and navigation.
  - `video.css`: Specific styling for video thumbnails and video listings.
- **Realistic Design Elements**: The project includes **cover pictures**, **icons**, and **video thumbnails** to mimic the YouTube browsing experience.
